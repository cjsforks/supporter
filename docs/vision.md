*Maxwell's demon* is a thought experiment which "shows that the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics has only a statistical certainty."[1]

The demon is a doorman. The demon is discerning. The demon decreases disorder.
However, the value of the doorman must exceed the wages of the doorman.[2]

A human doorman is capable of discerning only a finite number of people.
Robin Dunbar quantified this number to approximately 150. [3]

A doorman exceeds the Dunbar number by using proxies. Proxies include badges,
diplomas, titles, uniforms, language, shiboleths ...

... and on the internet superhighway; proxies empower gigascale computation.

However, humans remain limited in the ability to process information. And 
artifact proxies are inefficient.

Internet communities leverage computing resources to crowd source discernment.

Each member of a community electronically records judgments and an algorithm
compiles a curated doorman's list.

Google, Reddit, Hacker News, ... are doormen who discern through collective
intellegence a proxy decision. [4]

Google, etc., are doormen for information.

Universities, traditionally, are the doormen for professional organizations.

Keepers of religion, also, are doormen to communities of ethical behaviour.

This is the vision of `BibleFed.` An organization engine for communities.
